            \ you to make an exact search. Keywords surrounded by \n  quotation marks\
            \ are used to search for articles with the exact same keyword sequence.\
            \ \n  For example the query: \"Apple iPhone\" will return articles matching\
            \ at least once this sequence of keywords.\n- Logical AND Operator: This\
            \ operator allows you to make sure that several keywords are all used\
            \ in the article\n  search. By default the space character acts as an\
            \ AND operator, it is possible to replace the space character \n  by AND\
            \ to obtain the same result. For example the query: Apple Microsoft is\
            \ equivalent to Apple AND Microsoft\n- Logical OR Operator: This operator\
            \ allows you to retrieve articles matching the keyword a or the keyword\
            \ b.\n  It is important to note that this operator has a higher precedence\
            \ than the AND operator. For example the \n  query: Apple OR Microsoft\
            \ will return all articles matching the keyword Apple as well as all articles\
            \ matching \n  the keyword Microsoft\n- Logical NOT Operator: This operator\
            \ allows you to remove from the results the articles corresponding to\
            \ the\n  specified keywords. To use it, you need to add NOT in front of\
            \ each word or phrase surrounded by quotes.\n  For example the query:\

            \ you to make an exact search. Keywords surrounded by \n  quotation marks\
            \ are used to search for articles with the exact same keyword sequence.\
            \ \n  For example the query: \"Apple iPhone\" will return articles matching\
            \ at least once this sequence of keywords.\n- Logical AND Operator: This\
            \ operator allows you to make sure that several keywords are all used\
            \ in the article\n  search. By default the space character acts as an\
            \ AND operator, it is possible to replace the space character \n  by AND\
            \ to obtain the same result. For example the query: Apple Microsoft is\
            \ equivalent to Apple AND Microsoft\n- Logical OR Operator: This operator\
            \ allows you to retrieve articles matching the keyword a or the keyword\
            \ b.\n  It is important to note that this operator has a higher precedence\
            \ than the AND operator. For example the \n  query: Apple OR Microsoft\
            \ will return all articles matching the keyword Apple as well as all articles\
            \ matching \n  the keyword Microsoft\n- Logical NOT Operator: This operator\
            \ allows you to remove from the results the articles corresponding to\
            \ the\n  specified keywords. To use it, you need to add NOT in front of\
            \ each word or phrase surrounded by quotes.\n  For example the query:\
            \ Apple NOT iPhone will return all articles matching the keyword Apple\
